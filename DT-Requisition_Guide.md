# CREATING DT REQUISITIONS IN PEOPLESOFT
April 4, 2018

## Introduction
After years of preparation, months of training, and even more months of delay, the City and County of San Francisco has taken the plunge: goodbye to the decrepit, mainframe world of FAMIS, and hello to the modern, web-based world of PeopleSoft to manage every transaction in the City’s $10 billion budget!

The [SF Employee Portal](https://sfemployeeportalsupport.sfgov.org/support/home) contains a wealth of training and job aides designed for the citywide audience of budget, accounting, and procurement teams. We have tested the [eProcurement: Create a Requisition job aide](https://sfemployeeportalsupport.sfgov.org/support/solutions/articles/22000209326-create-a-requisition), and it is technically accurate. It contains 97% of what you need to know to successfully create a requisition for the Department of Technology. This document will fill in that missing 3%, warn you of potential pitfalls, and stiffen your spine to jump into the future.

## Pep Talk and a Word of Caution
We all know that the PeopleSoft rollout remains a work in progress: errors in contract conversion are still being uncovered, most vendors still lack access, many budget codes are confusing or incorrect, individual role-mapping appears to be . . . creative? 
BUT, the PeopleSoft system is live, FAMIS is now frozen, and our ability to keep the lights and Internet on for the City depends on our ability to get this work-in-progress of a 
 The City made the decision to make this an open system. This essentially means that “trust is given, not earned.” We have visibility and access to budgets outside of DT’s. This, combined with the bugs in the system, mean it can be easy to accidentally misroute our requisitions, purchase orders, and contracts. **It’s not the end of the world if-and-when-mistakes happen!** This guide will help you avoid some pitfalls, but there will undoubtedly be more pitfalls. That’s okay! If we can’t correct an errant requisition, we can always delete it and start over. Take a deep breath, pour another cup of coffee, and we’ll begin. 

## What You Need and Where to Get It
Before you login to the PeopleSoft system, we suggest you first take a few minutes to gather all of the information you will need. If your requisition has missing budget codes, you want to find out now before you invest the time to start entering all the information. Here is what you need to create a DT requisition:
*	[eProcurement: Create a Requisition job aide](https://sfemployeeportalsupport.sfgov.org/support/solutions/articles/22000209326-create-a-requisition)
*	This DT-specific supplemental guide
*	PeopleSoft budget codes for your requisition 

The PeopleSoft budget codes provide the key information to ensure that your requisition is attached to the correct portion of the budget and routed to the correct approval path.
