# CREATING DT REQUISITIONS IN PEOPLESOFT
April 4, 2018

## Introduction
After years of preparation, months of training, and even more months of delay, the City and County of San Francisco has taken the plunge: goodbye to the decrepit, mainframe world of FAMIS, and hello to the modern, web-based world of PeopleSoft to manage every transaction in the Cityâ€™s $10 billion budget!
The [SF Employee Portal](https://sfemployeeportalsupport.sfgov.org/support/home) contains a wealth of training and job aides designed for the citywide audience of budget, accounting, and procurement teams. We have tested the [eProcurement: Create a Requisition job aide](https://sfemployeeportalsupport.sfgov.org/support/solutions/articles/22000209326-create-a-requisition), and it is technically accurate. It contains 97% of what you need to know to successfully create a requisition for the Department of Technology. This document will fill in that missing 3%, warn you of potential pitfalls, and stiffen your spine to jump into the future.
